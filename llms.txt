Some notes for better navigating this repository

- `backend/` contains backend code written using `fastapi` framework
- `frontend/` contains frontend code written using `reflex` framework
- `backend/src/mindweaver/fw` contains a crud framework for the backend

- To test the backend, use `uv run --package backend pytest backend/tests`
- Prefer error 422 for validation issues in backend so that it is consistent with fastapi
