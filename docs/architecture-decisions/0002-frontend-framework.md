# 0002. Frontend Framework Selection

- **Status**: Accepted
- **Date**: 2026-02-26
- **Author**: Antigravity

## Context

The Mindweaver frontend needs to provide a rich, interactive, and responsive user interface for managing data platform components. It must integrate seamlessly with the FastAPI backend.

## Decision

We have selected **React** as the frontend library.

## Consequences

- **Component-Based**: Allows for highly reusable UI components (e.g., `DynamicForm`, `ListingView`).
- **Ecosystem**: Access to a vast ecosystem of libraries for routing, state management, and UI components.
- **Performance**: Virtual DOM provides efficient rendering for complex interfaces.
- **Consistency**: Enables a modern look and feel consistent with industry standards.
