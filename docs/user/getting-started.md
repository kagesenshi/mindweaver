# Getting Started

This guide will help you set up Mindweaver for development and explore its features.

## Prerequisites

Before installing Mindweaver, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Python 3.13+**
- **Node.js (v18+)** and **npm**
- **uv** (Fast Python package manager): [Installation Guide](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv)
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**
- **Kubernetes Cluster** (e.g., k3s, Kind, or a cloud provider) and **ArgoCD** (standard components).

## Development Setup

### 1. Infrastructure Services

Start the backing services (PostgreSQL and Redis) using Docker Compose from the root directory:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### 2. Application Installation

Run the unified setup script to install dependencies for both the backend and frontend:

```bash
python setup-dev.py
```

This script performs the following:
- Syncs backend dependencies using `uv`.
- Installs frontend dependencies using `npm`.
- Runs database migrations.
- Generates a suggested `MINDWEAVER_FERNET_KEY` for encryption.

### 3. Environment Configuration

If you need to customize your configuration, create or edit the `.env` file in the `backend/` directory.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Make sure to set `MINDWEAVER_FERNET_KEY` in your environment or `.env` file to the key generated by `setup-dev.py`.

## Running Mindweaver

To start the entire Mindweaver stack (API, Frontend, Celery Worker, and Scheduler), run the following command from the root directory:

```bash
python start-dev.py
```

- **Frontend**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Backend API**: `http://localhost:8000`

## Next Steps

Once Mindweaver is running, you can proceed to the **[Core Concepts](core-concepts.md)** to understand how to manage your projects and deployments.
